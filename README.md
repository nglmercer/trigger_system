## Quick Example

```yaml
# rules/example.yaml
id: "high-value-transaction"
on: "PAYMENT_RECEIVED"
if:
  field: "data.amount"
  operator: "GT"
  value: 100
do:
  type: "send_alert"
  params:
    message: "Big spender! $${data.amount}"
```

## Features

- **Protocol Agnostic**: Works with HTTP, WebSockets, Game Events, CLI, etc.
- **Hot Reloading**: Edit rules in YAML and see changes instantly.
- **Type-Safe**: Built with TypeScript and ArkType for robust validation.
- **Stateful**: Memories and counters allow for complex behaviors.
